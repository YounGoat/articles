##	Before Installation

What's Docker? [*Docker products simplify, manage and secure containerized applications*][1.a]. They are:
*	Docker Enterprise
*	Docker Desktop
*	Docker Engine

[*Get Started with Docker*][1.b] will help you understand what to do with Docker according to what you are.

[*Overview of Docker editions*][1.c] will help you understand __CE__, __EE__ and the difference.

__ATTENTION:__ In Mac OS X, Docker Engine does not run natively. It actually runs in a virtual machine.

__Now, you knew it!__

##	Install

[Sign up][2.a] to [Docker Hub][2.b], then download  [__Docker Desktop (Mac)__][2.c]. Attention, it is a community edition (CE). If interested in enterprise edition, please read [*Introducing Docker Desktop Enterprise*][2.d]. 

You will get a [dmg][R.001] file. When download completed, open and install by "drag & drop" to os Applications folder.

__Now, you got it!__

__EXTENDED:__ Installing via homebrew is another choice,
```bash
# Install Docker Community Edition (CE).
brew cask install docker
```

__EXTENDED:__ Read following documents for more details:
*	[*Install Docker Desktop for Mac*][2.e]
*	[*Docker Desktop for Mac vs. Docker Toolbox*][2.f]

##	Install More

Softwares introduced in this section are not necessary.

[__Kitematic__][3.a] is *now part of Docker Toolbox*. It is not neccessary but helpful if you feel easy with [GUI][R.002].

[__Kubernetes__ (k8s)][3.b] is more difficult to be understood by newbies. 
> [Kubernetes vs. Docker: What Does It Really Mean?][3.c]  
> Docker is a platform and tool for building, distributing, and running Docker containers. It offers its own native clustering tool that can be used to orchestrate and schedule containers on machine clusters. Kubernetes is a container orchestration system for Docker containers that is more extensive than Docker Swarm and is meant to coordinate clusters of nodes at scale in production in an efficient manner.

##	Get Started

[*Get started*][4.a] will help you not only practice with Docker, but also understand it. After reading, you should get answers to the following questions.

###	What are __image__ and __container__?

Building with a file named `Dockerfile` will generate a new image. Running means to create a new container and execute commands which defined in an image.

```bash
docker build 
```

> ... a container is nothing but a running process, ... each container interacts with its own private filesystem; this filesystem is provided by a Docker image.  
> A container runs natively on Linux and shares the kernel of the host machine with other containers.

Read on: [Containers and virtual machines](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/#containers-and-virtual-machines)

###	What is __Docker Machine__?

__Docker Machine__ is neither a machine nor a virtual machine, but 
> a tool that lets you install Docker Engine on virtual hosts, and manage the hosts with docker-machine commands.

###	What are __services__, __swarm__ and __stack__?

To be continued.

###	How to push an image to hub.docker.com?

```bash
# Login with your Docker Hub account.
docker login

# Create new tag for existing image.
docker tag <image> <username>/<reponame>:<tagname>

# Push to hub.docker.com.
docker push <username>/<reponame>:<tagname>
```

###	Play With Third-Party Registry

```bash
# Pull image from third-party registry.
git pull <hostname>/<username>/<reponame>:<tagname>
```

__ATTENTION:__ Add the hostname to "insecure registries" if the registry does not accept SSL connection (https not supported).

##	Something You May Be Interested With

*	__Where images stored?__  
	You may get the answer via the *Disk* panel in the *Preferences* dialog of *Docker Desktop*. By default, it is  
	`~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/Data/com.docker.driver.amd64-linux/Docker.qcow2`  
	![Preferences / Disk](photos/docker-desktop-preferences-disk.png)

# Create an image from Dockerfile.
# <path> should be a directory containing a file named "Dockerfile".
docker build <path>

# Create an alias for an image.
# <image> may be repository name or image id.
docker tag <image> <new_name>[:<tag>]

# -- info --
